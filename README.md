# Getting Started with Zer0x App

## Deployed Demo App  

You can interact with the App in order to perform KYC and chains interactions by visiting 
Cypher Zer0x App : [kyc.zer0x.xyz](https://kyc.zer0x.xyz/)  

For the KYC process we combined [HARPIE](https://harpie.io/) stack with [PolygonID](https://polygonid.com/) to issue credentials only for users with valid address (addresses that are not linked to any malicious/fraudulous actvivity).  

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
